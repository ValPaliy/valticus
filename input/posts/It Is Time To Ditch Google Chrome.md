## It Is Time To Ditch Google Chrome

While it is true that Google's [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) holds the largest number of users to date, I have recently switched to Microsoft's [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) web browser.

Edge can now use all the extensions I had in Chrome, and Edge has many great features built in which Chrome doesn't. Like Web Capture, for example. Edge is also faster and loads web pages when Chrome can't (this was recently discovered by yours truly when my network connection speed dropped due to technical issues on my service provider's side).

I could go on comparing the browsers, but instead I am going to share a video with you, which had helped me to make the final decision and switch.

Here it is. Although a bit outdated, it's still good.

<div style="text-align:center;" class="video">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v73TaVDWh4s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<i>Note: I am still using Google's services, such as [Gmail](https://gmail.com/), for example. Google is too big of a player to ignore completely ;)</i>

Thank you for your time and attention! I hope you have a great day!
