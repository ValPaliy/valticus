## How To Change Your GitHub Theme

So, as you may or may not know, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is testing themes for its website, and the feature is now in beta according to [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-theme-settings).

To change how your [GitHub](https://github.com/) looks, you need to log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, click your profile pictures, choose *Settings* > *Appearance* and on the section that opens, choose one of the three themes that are currently available.

Below are the screen shots, courtesy of [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-theme-settings):

<div class="align_center" style="height:auto; max-width: 100%; border:none; display:block;">
<img src='/img/github-theme-userbar-account-settings.png' alt='GitHub Account Settings' title='GitHub Account Settings'  class="align_center">
<br />
<img src='/img/github-theme-appearance-tab.png' alt='GitHub Appearance' title='GitHub Appearance' class="align_center">
<br />
<img src='/img/github-theme-theme-settings-radio-buttons.png' alt='GitHub Themes' title='GitHub Themes' class="align_center">
</div>
*Please not that, as I have mentioned in the beginning of this article, that the theme feature is currently in beta, and is subject to change.*
