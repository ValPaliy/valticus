## How To Delete Unused Google Profile Pictures

Ever since [Google](https://google.com/) discontinued [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B) (its social network) there's no obvious way to delete unused profile pictures from your account.

However, there's a workaround I've tested personally.

To delete your unused profile pictures (or any photos you might want to delete from your [Google](https://google.com/) account), you have to be signed in to your google account. After you are signed in, follow this simple steps:

 1. Open [get.google.com/albumarchive](http://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFIPhzX_AokWwcTXiiIJmD0oj_Jgx_FUDDQzRxEKLowaKN9A2d8WeMA9wlCq7-TKYd9aAg3ZkFaZZ8jQJcu8-y9TKaaCF0vxSw).

 2. Find folder called **Profile Photos**.

 3. Select the  **photo** you would like to remove from the archive.

 4. Click on  **More Options**.

 5. Select  **Delete Photo**.

There, you should be all set! Thank you for the time you spent reading this quick, but hopefully useful suggestion.
