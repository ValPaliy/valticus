## Plans For The Nearest Future Of This Blog

Quick post on my plans for this blog.

Basically, I am planning to recommend you, the reader, what I use myself - be it a computer keyboard I use, a book I've read or a coffee brand I like.

What will be covered (the list is subject to change with time):

- Programming
- Coding
- Books
- Hardware
- Software
- Merchandise

Hope you will find my recommendations useful, or at the very least - entertaining.
