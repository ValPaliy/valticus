## Mobile Friendly Website And Why It Matters

I have always tried and followed the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) in every project I worked on. It's not always an easy thing to do, but Web Accessibility (WA) is very important, as we all have difficulties when interacting with a computer or mobile screen, in one way or the other. For example, my eyesight is dropping as I am approaching the age of forty.

According to [this article](https://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/accessibility-statistics#:~:text=57%20Million%20Americans%20have%20a%20Disability&text=Consider%20impairments%20that%20impact%20accessibility,websites%2C%20applications%2C%20and%20documents.):

57 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE A DISABILITY
- 19.9 million (8.2%) have difficulty lifting or grasping. This could, for example impact their use of a mouse or keyboard.
- 15.2 million (6.3%) have a cognitive, mental, or emotional impairment.
- 8.1 million (3.3%) have a vision impairment. These people might rely on a screen magnifier or a screen reader, or might have a form of color blindness.
- 7.6 million (3.1%) have a hearing impairment.  They might rely on transcripts and / or captions for audio and video media.

Naturally, after creating this website and deploying it (the story of how I did it is [here](https://valticus.cf/posts/how-to-deploy-on-netlify)) I tested it with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) (World Wide Web Consortium is an organization responsible for web standards and guidelines).

This website had 3 minor errors, which I had fixed in almost no time, and now the W3C Validator badge is part of the footer.
