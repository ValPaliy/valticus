## Mobile Friendly Website And Why It Matters

I have always tried and followed the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) in every project I worked on. It's not always an easy thing to do, but Web Accessibility (WA) is very important, as we all have difficulties when interacting with a computer or mobile screen, in one way or the other. For example, my eyesight is dropping as I am approaching the age of forty.

According to [this article](https://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/accessibility-statistics#:~:text=57%20Million%20Americans%20have%20a%20Disability&text=Consider%20impairments%20that%20impact%20accessibility,websites%2C%20applications%2C%20and%20documents.):

57 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE A DISABILITY
- 19.9 million (8.2%) have difficulty lifting or grasping. This could, for example impact their use of a mouse or keyboard.
- 15.2 million (6.3%) have a cognitive, mental, or emotional impairment.
- 8.1 million (3.3%) have a vision impairment. These people might rely on a screen magnifier or a screen reader, or might have a form of color blindness.
- 7.6 million (3.1%) have a hearing impairment.  They might rely on transcripts and / or captions for audio and video media.

Naturally, after creating this website and deploying it (the story of how I did it is [here](https://valticus.cf/posts/how-to-deploy-on-netlify)) I tested it with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) (World Wide Web Consortium is an organization responsible for web standards and guidelines).

This website had 3 minor errors, which I had [fixed in almost no time](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fvalticus.cf%2F), and now the [W3C Validator badge](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/Icons) is proudly displayed on this website.

One other important aspect of WA in our modern times is mobile friendliness. In other words, modern websites have to be easy to navigate on a device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. So naturally, I check this website of mine to see how well it stands as far as being mobile friendly goes. To do this, all I had to do is google `mobile friendly test`, enter the URL into the provided field and click RUN TEST:

Everything looks pretty good to me. As always, thank you very much for taking your time to read what I have to say!
