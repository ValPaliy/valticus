<p><strong>Crown IT Group</strong>
Project Manager/Tester/Developer
January 2009 - September 2011 (2 years 9 months)
Go on to the web site to find out more about the company. CITG develops
great web sites, and is now out of the shadow of sub-contracts. Please contact
me to discuss opportunities further - I am sure we can help you create your
next Drupal web site or a Facebook Application.
My main responsibility at Crown IT Group is to manage the team and its
projects according to the Agile principles. This invokes fast and efficient
decision making, problem solving, and time management. I endorsed the use
of Drupal CMS to speed up the development process. I am also responsible
for overseeing custom web site development. We use the Code Igniter
framework for that. I encourage heavy use of Open Source Software and
Solutions during the developing process, to make sure no laws are broken.
I myself am a strong believer in an Open Source nature of Information
Technologies, and try to bring the same notion to my work. The work is done
form home, over the Internet, and the team currently consists of 5 people.</p>

management, web site UI consulting, public relations, brand development,
web site traffic growth, translation of web site content, writing and translating
web site content, advertising revenue, new development deals generation.
As a web consultant I made sure the web sites our team created were easily
usable and accessible. This involved all kinds of tests I had to performed, even
accessing our web sites with my eyes closed.
As a team leader I was to make sure the work flow is optimized, the resources
are spread accordingly, and the team itself is interconnected. I had endorsed
daily meetings at the office, implementation of new technologies, such as
the use of Content Management Systems and Zend Framework for custom
PHP development. I consider the use of CMS when there were only a few of
them, as well, as well as using a PHP framework to optimize the development
process an achievement of my own, and the DeepArtDesign as a whole, as a
result.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenWorks</strong>

project manager at OxygenWorks I was responsible for managing various
projects, which were mainly assignments from clients overseas. My team (and
myself as a leader) was responsible for creating web sites from the ground
up. This included creating a design mock up, discussing it with clients (I was
responsible for all the communication), getting the feedback back to my team,
and making sure we, as a team, acted upon it to a 100% of client satisfaction.
My team consisted of approximately 10 IT-specialist, administrators, designers,
and programmers. Back in 2002 we were the only team in Nikolaev (to my
knowledge) that had an organized team that worked for clients overseas. I
take personal pride in getting together a group of people that worked as one,
utilizing HTML and Flash. Flash, at that time, was something new. The work
was a done from home.</p>
<p>As a search engine optimization specialist, I personally made sure different
modifications to the code were made, in order to make sure the sites we make
get a good search engine position. This required HTML coding experience,
Photoshop mock ups to HTML transaction, CSS, and DHTML programming,
which I had to take on during the course of a few projects.
As a participant of an International Scientific Conference titled &quot;Higher
Education Perspectives: The Role Of Inter University Consortia&quot;, presented
a later published speech entitled &quot;My Experience In The United States: What
Makes A University Better&quot;, wrote an article telling my respected audience
about the life of people with disabilities in the United Stated, particularly
students.</p>

<p>At the same time, while leading a Bible Study, I was responsible for spreading
the Word Of God to the students who were interested in what the Bible has to
say. We had frequent meeting during which we studied theology and watched
theological movies, such as JESUS by Campus Crusade for Christ. While
