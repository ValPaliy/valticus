Y﻿ou may remember my article on \[why I don't use Netlify CMS](https://valticus.pro/posts/why-i-dont-use-netlify-cms-yet/). Well, the problem was that I couldn't get it to work with \[Statiq Web](https://www.statiq.dev/web).

I﻿ have since moved to \[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and am now using \[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to write drafts for my articles, which I think is awesome!

I﻿ will show you how you can do the same, if you wish. Follow me!
