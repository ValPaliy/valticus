While it is true that Google's [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) holds the largest number of users to date, I have recently switched to Microsoft's [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) web browser.

Edge can now use all the extensions I had in Chrome, and Edge has many great features built in which Chrome doesn't. Like Web Capture, for example. Edge is also faster and loads web pages when Chrome can't (this was recently discovered by yours truly when my network connection speed dropped due to technical issues on my service provider's side).

<i>Note: I am still using Google's services, such as [Gmail](https://gmail.com/), for example. Google is too big of a player to ignore completely ;)</i>

Thank you for your time and attention! I hope you have a great day!
