For a long time I have been a big fan of [Sarah Drasner's theme](https://valticus.pro/posts/my-favorite-visual-studio-code-theme) for Visual Studio Code, and even used [a port of it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaos.nightowl) in [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Ever since I've started learning [.Net Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) on both Linux and Windows, I 've also started using the default Visual Studio 2019 [theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kast789.vs-2019-theme) in both the IDE, and the editor. Simply because I like unity across the developer tools I use.

Here are a few screenshots:

{{< figure src="/images/vscode-2019-theme2.png" title="Visual Studio 2019 Dark Theme Screenshot 2" alt="Visual Studio 2019 Dark Theme Screenshot 2" >}}

The said theme is also a part of the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/).

I also use the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) to complete the experience in vscode, and [File Icons extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.FileIcons) in Visual Studio 2019 Community.

Thank you for taking your time to read this small article! Hope you've found it useful.
