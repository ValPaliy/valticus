AI, or [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), is big at the moment, and to no surprise. AI can help humanity in many different areas, such as diagnosing an illness at an early stage, or assisting a driver with direction, or driving you to a desired destination.

While it is debatable whether or not we should trust AI to take over crucial areas of our lives (have you seen [_"Terminator?"_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)>)), one area I found Artificial Intelligence to be particularly useful in is programming. Using the right tools, you can save yourself a lot of time while coding with AI enabled.

You have two options if you want AI to help you write code.

1. **Kite**. It is a well known tool available for many IDEs and editors. It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kite.com/download/?loc=top_nav). The only problem is, Kite seems to be unavailable at the moment of writing.

2. **TabNine**. This is what I've been using personally in my Visual Studio Code, and I like TabNine very much. TabNine can be installed in VSCode from [here](https://www.tabnine.com/install).

To quote [the developers of TabNine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode): _"Tabnine is an AI-powered code completion extension trusted by millions of developers around the world. Whether you’re just getting started as a developer or if you’ve been doing it for decades, Tabnine will help you code twice as fast with half the keystrokes – all in your favorite IDE."_

It's very easy to set up and is even easier to use. I think you should give TabNine Cloud Assistant a try.

Hope this article will help you get even more productive while writing code. Thanks for your time, and have a great day!
