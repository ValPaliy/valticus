Let's face it - as developers we look at code 90% of our time we spend in front of the monitor. While there tons of fonts available for our favorite text editors, both free and paid, I have found one font in particular to be extremely enjoyable (and believe me - I've tried a few).

That is - [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), a free and open source font from the very same company that brought us tools like [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

The font is free and open source, as I've already mentioned, meaning you can download it, install it in your [operating system](https://valticus.pro/tags/operating-system) and configure your [editor/IDE](https://valticus.pro/tags/editor/) to use it.

Take a look:

I find the difference a striking one. JetBrains Mono is indeed optimized for reading code. You could also use it system-wide, if you want, as it's very easy on the eyes. Also, did I mention it supports ligatures? ;) Well, it does!

Here's an example of what font ligatures are (using yet another great coding font called [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode):
