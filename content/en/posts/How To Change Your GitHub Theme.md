So, as you may or may not know, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is testing themes for its website, and the feature is now in beta according to [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-theme-settings).

To change how your [GitHub](https://github.com/) looks, you need to log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, click your profile pictures, choose _Settings_ > _Appearance_ and on the section that opens, choose one of the three themes that are currently available.

Below are the screen shots, courtesy of [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-theme-settings):

_Please note that, as I have mentioned in the beginning of this article, that the theme feature is currently in beta, and is subject to change._
