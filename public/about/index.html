Go on to the web site to find out more about the company. CITG develops
great web sites, and is now out of the shadow of sub-contracts. Please contact
me to discuss opportunities further - I am sure we can help you create your
next Drupal web site or a Facebook Application.
My main responsibility at Crown IT Group is to manage the team and its
projects according to the Agile principles. This invokes fast and efficient
decision making, problem solving, and time management. I endorsed the use
of Drupal CMS to speed up the development process. I am also responsible
for overseeing custom web site development. We use the Code Igniter
framework for that. I encourage heavy use of Open Source Software and
Solutions during the developing process, to make sure no laws are broken.
I myself am a strong believer in an Open Source nature of Information
Technologies, and try to bring the same notion to my work. The work is done
form home, over the Internet, and the team currently consists of 5 people.</del></p><p><strong>ViPDesign</strong>

As a web consultant I made sure the web sites our team created were easily
usable and accessible. This involved all kinds of tests I had to performed, even
accessing our web sites with my eyes closed.
As a team leader I was to make sure the work flow is optimized, the resources
are spread accordingly, and the team itself is interconnected. I had endorsed
daily meetings at the office, implementation of new technologies, such as
the use of Content Management Systems and Zend Framework for custom
PHP development. I consider the use of CMS when there were only a few of
them, as well, as well as using a PHP framework to optimize the development
