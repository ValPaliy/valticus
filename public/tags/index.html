                built in which Chrome doesn&rsquo;t. Like Web Capture, for

                can&rsquo;t (this was recently discovered by yours truly when my

                was with Cygwin. But Cygwin is rather bulky and can take a long
                time to download if you are on a slower Internet connection. As
                I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I love Linux for its stability and
                reliability. So I was looking for a simpler way to execute Linux
                commands in Windows, and found it! I present to you GNU on
                Windows also known as GoW).

                For a long time I have been a big fan of Sarah Drasner&rsquo;s
                theme for Visual Studio Code, and even used a port of it in
                Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. Ever since I&rsquo;ve
                started learning .Net Framework on both Linux and Windows, I
                &rsquo;ve also started using the default Visual Studio 2019
                theme in both the IDE, and the editor. Simply because I like
                unity across the developer tools I use.

                Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (or simply vscode, or even
                code) is an editor developed by Microsoft. The editor was
                released back in 2015 and by now is considered one of the best
                if not the best code editors out there. I admit, I used Vim for
                a bit, but switched back to vscode+vim plugin, since I work with
                .Net nowadays. I am going to tell you about my favorite set of

                believe me - I&rsquo;ve tried a few). That is - JetBrains Mono,
                a free and open source font from the very same company that
                brought us tools like WebStorm and PyCharm.

                spend most of their day looking at code in their favorite
                editor. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned a few themes I like, and
                today I am going to teach you how to set your editor up in such
                away that the theme changes automatically depending on what time
                of day it is. Take a look at the three screenshots above: Night
                Owl Light Cobalt2 Night Owl The above are the three wonderful
                editor themes I use throughout the day (Night Owl Light is in
                effect from 6am to noon, Cobalt2 is noon to 6pm and Night Owl is
                my go to theme from 6pm to 6am, because it&rsquo;s, well,
                perfect for us night owls out there).

                So, as you may or may not know, GitHub is testing themes for its
                website, and the feature is now in beta according to GitHub
                Docs. To change how your GitHub looks, you need to log in to
                your GitHub account, click your profile pictures, choose
                Settings &gt; Appearance and on the section that opens, choose
                one of the three themes that are currently available. Below are

                AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is big at the moment, and to no
                surprise. AI can help humanity in many different areas, such as

                with direction, or driving you to a desired destination. While

                AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is big at the moment, and to no
                surprise. AI can help humanity in many different areas, such as
                diagnosing an illness at an early stage, or assisting a driver
                with direction, or driving you to a desired destination. While
                it is debatable whether or not we should trust AI to take over
                crucial areas of our lives (have you seen
                &ldquo;Terminator?&rdquo;), one area I found Artificial
                Intelligence to be particularly useful in is programming.

                So, as you may or may not know, GitHub is testing themes for its
                website, and the feature is now in beta according to GitHub
                Docs. To change how your GitHub looks, you need to log in to
                your GitHub account, click your profile pictures, choose
                Settings &gt; Appearance and on the section that opens, choose
                one of the three themes that are currently available. Below are
                the screen shots, courtesy of GitHub Docs: GitHub Account

                have mentioned in the beginning of this article, that the theme
                feature is currently in beta, and is subject to change.

                Settings &gt; Appearance and on the section that opens, choose
                one of the three themes that are currently available. Below are
