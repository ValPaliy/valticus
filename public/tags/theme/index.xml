      <description>Eye comfort is very important, especially to programmers, who spend most of their day looking at code in their favorite editor.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned a few themes I like, and today I am going to teach you how to set your editor up in such away that the theme changes automatically depending on what time of day it is.
Take a look at the three screenshots above: Cobalt2 Night Owl Light Night Owl The above are the three wonderful editor themes I use throughout the day (Night Owl Light is in effect from 6am to noon, Cobalt2 is noon to 6pm and Night Owl is my go to theme from 6pm to 6am, because it&amp;rsquo;s, well, perfect for us night owls out there).</description>

      <description>For a long time I have been a big fan of Sarah Drasner&amp;rsquo;s theme for Visual Studio Code, and even used a port of it in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning .Net Framework on both Linux and Windows, I &amp;rsquo;ve also started using the default Visual Studio 2019 theme in both the IDE, and the editor. Simply because I like unity across the developer tools I use.</description>

      <description>So, as you may or may not know, GitHub is testing themes for its website, and the feature is now in beta according to GitHub Docs.
To change how your GitHub looks, you need to log in to your GitHub account, click your profile pictures, choose Settings &amp;gt; Appearance and on the section that opens, choose one of the three themes that are currently available.
Below are the screen shots, courtesy of GitHub Docs: GitHub Account Settings GitHub Appearance GitHub Themes Please note that, as I have mentioned in the beginning of this article, that the theme feature is currently in beta, and is subject to change.</description>

      <description>Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (or simply vscode, or even code) is an editor developed by Microsoft. The editor was released back in 2015 and by now is considered one of the best if not the best code editors out there. I admit, I used Vim for a bit, but switched back to vscode+vim plugin, since I work with .Net nowadays. I am going to tell you about my favorite set of plugins in one of my next posts.</description>
