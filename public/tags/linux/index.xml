      <description>Oftentimes, when you buy a new PC, it comes preloaded with applications. Some of them are essential, like an anti-virus, and some of them are not. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that the responsiveness of your device (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be a computer, it can be a mobile phone or a tablet, too) depends on how many applications you have installed. It is especially true for mobile devices, where applications are often started at boot and remain in the memory even if they are not used, draining battery power.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my blog you might have noticed that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything in quite some time. &amp;ldquo;So, what&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;, you might ask.
Well, long story short - lots of things have happened March through May, 2021. Most of them unpleasant to say the least and personal, so I&amp;rsquo;d rather not disclose the details. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a few things related to Information Technologies.
I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to Windows entirely.</description>

      <description>For a long time the only way to launch Linux commands in Windows was with Cygwin. But Cygwin is rather bulky and can take a long time to download if you are on a slower Internet connection.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, I love Linux for its stability and reliability. So I was looking for a simpler way to execute Linux commands in Windows, and found it!
I present to you GNU on Windows also known as GoW).</description>

      <description>For a long time I have been a big fan of Sarah Drasner&amp;rsquo;s theme for Visual Studio Code, and even used a port of it in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning .Net Framework on both Linux and Windows, I &amp;rsquo;ve also started using the default Visual Studio 2019 theme in both the IDE, and the editor. Simply because I like unity across the developer tools I use.</description>
