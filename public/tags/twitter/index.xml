      <description>As you are probably well aware, Twitter has recently been bought by none other than Elon Musk himself. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I am only noticing negative sides of this acquisition. I will try to explain why within following paragraphs.
Firstly, I am not talking about the blue stars here, either. It goes deeper. Twitter feels less professional as a whole, since Elon bought it. There had been many lay-offs, many people leaving the company at their own will because of bad management, and so on, and so forth.</description>
