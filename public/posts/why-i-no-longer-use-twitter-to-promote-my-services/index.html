			<p>As you are probably well aware, Twitter has recently been bought by none other than Elon Musk himself. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I am only noticing negative sides of this acquisition. I will try to explain why within following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am not talking about the blue stars here, either. It goes deeper. Twitter feels less professional as a whole, since Elon bought it. There had been many lay-offs, many people leaving the company at their own will because of bad management, and so on, and so forth. At this point, Twitter just feels like it&rsquo;s hanging in the air about to drop itself into a volcano and be forgotten.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I use it less ever since the owner of Twitter changed. But I didn&rsquo;t think of abandoning it completely until a few days ago, when I tried to follow someone and was told I can&rsquo;t. No explanation followed. Nothing. A simple: “You can&rsquo;t follow anyone at this point.” That&rsquo;s not a nice way to treat an account that was registered back in 2008, has a good standing and a decent follower base (I am not a celebrity, so no million followers lost, thankfully). That is my second reason.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d given an opportunity to address Elon Musk directly, here&rsquo;s what I would most likely say to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Musk, sir,
You are free to run your company however you see fit, but
you really need to learn to socialize. What I mean by that is - making
spaceships and cars is one thing. Dealing with a large social
platform, where people interact and express their opinions (freedom of
speech is still a thing, you know) - is quite another. Stop treating
Twitter like a new toy of yours! If you play with it rough, it will
break. Of course, I might be a nobody compared to you, but believe me,
sir, I express many people&rsquo;s opinion. At this point, I regret I ever
bought a biography book about you a couple of years ago&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above is what has been boiling up inside me for quite some time now. Twitter is only a part of what bothers me, as far as Elon&rsquo;s recent actions are concerned. Perhaps one day I will tell you, dear reader, the whole story.
There are no hyperlinks in this article. I am not trying to use a hot topic to get more visitors, but merely expressing my feelings.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and attention. Be safe out there!</p>
<p>Update: As of April 9th, 2023, I no longer user Instagram (ValPaliy) or Twitter (ValPaliy).</p>
