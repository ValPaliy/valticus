                  I own a mechanical keyboard for some time now, and I must say
                  - in my opinion it is way better compared to my old membrane
                  keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mechanical keyboards are gaining popularity as of late. While
                  they were on the expensive side at first, you can buy (and
                  assemble) one for under $100 today. Granted, you might need to
                  get the keys and key caps to suit your needs in addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While gathering material for this article, I was surprised to
                  find out how many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts are out
                  there in the World. People even have competitions over whose
                  custom-built mechanical keyboard is better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, I asked myself: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hype all
                  about?&rdquo; Why do people chose mechanical keyboards over
                  more traditional (and less expensive) membrane keyboards?
                  Within the following paragraphs is what I was able to find
                  out.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Mechanical Keyboards</strong></p>
                <p>
                  The <strong>main difference</strong> between a mechanical and
                  a membrane keyboard is that mechanical keyboards use key
                  switches with springs inside them, which prolongs the lifespan
                  of a mechanical keyboard when compared to a membrane one. For
                  a hardcore gamer, those key switches also provide better
                  tactile feel and feedback. And more precision compared to a
                  membrane based keyboard. We are talking e-sports level of
                  gaming here, where every keystroke is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There exist a few <strong>types of switches</strong> you can
                  put into your mechanical keyboard, depending on what you are
                  trying to achieve:
                </p>
                <p><em>Linear switches</em></p>
                <p>
                  There is no noise or feedback when keys are pressed. Each time
                  you press a key, you will reach the bottom of each key press
                  (the actuation point).
                </p>
                <p><em>Tactile switches</em></p>
                <p>
                  Tactile switches give you touch (or tactile) feedback when you
                  hit the actuation point. I.e. you will feel a bump each time a
                  key reaches the actuation point.
                </p>
                <p><em>Clicky switches</em></p>
                <p>
                  A clicky switch provides you with a click sound each time the
                  key registers (hits the actuation point).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Personally, I prefer the clicky switches because when using
                  them, my keyboard feel like an old typewriter, and I like
                  that. Of course, clicky switches produce more noise, so if
                  that&rsquo;s an issue in your case - chose the tactile
                  switches as they are obviously quieter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pros</strong> of a mechanical keyboard are: long life
                  span, durability, great typing feedback, stability. Keep in
                  mind that in mechanical keyboards everything can be replaced -
                  the chassis, the cord, the key switches and even the key caps
                  (you can even have custom key caps designed to make your
                  keyboard unique). You can even get all three switch types and
                  try each one to see what you like best. Also, the switches can
                  be greased for a smoother performance. That&rsquo;s definitely
                  something a membrane keyboard does not allow you to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cons</strong> of a mechanical keyboard are: noise,
                  higher price, higher weight. If you are a gamer that likes to
                  keep your keyboard on your lap while playing, a more
                  traditional gaming keyboard would be better for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are a few pictures of each part of a mechanical keyboard
                  as they can be
                  <a href="https://Amazon.com">seen on Amazon</a>:

                </p>
                <p>
                  As I have already mentioned, each key switch can be taken
                  apart and greased for better performance:

                <p>
                  So, to sum the mechanical part of this article - people go for
                  mechanical keyboards when they need total control of how their
                  keyboard feels, sounds and looks like. That is, obviously, a
                  generalization, and as I dive deeper into the realm of
                  mechanical keyboards, I will write more detailed reviews, so
                  stay tuned for future updates.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Membrane Keyboards</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We all know what a membrane keyboard is. They have been around
                  for years, and I think it would be safe to say that 90% of
                  computers use them.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img
                    src="/images/keyboard-membrane.png"
                    alt="A membrane keyboard"
                  />
                  <figcaption>
                    <h4>A membrane keyboard</h4>
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                  The membrane keyboard can not be customized in any way apart
                  from LED coloring if the keyboard has LEDs built in (which you
                  can add to a mechanical keyboard too, by the way). You pretty
                  much get what you buy and that&rsquo;s it. If you have been
                  following my articles here, you will know that membrane
                  keyboards can be gaming keyboards too! Membrane keyboards
                  cover what most casual gamers need and are pretty precise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pros</strong> of a membrane keyboard are: satisfying
                  feedback, little to no noise, variety, small size, lower
                  prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cons</strong> of a membrane keyboard are: not as
                  sturdy on your desk, it&rsquo;s hard to replace parts,
                  generally short life span. And most importantly - no way to
                  customize your membrane keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conclusion: as mechanical keyboards are getting cheaper, being
                  as reliable and customizable as they are, they will most
                  likely dominate the keyboard market. For now, we have to wait
                  and see.
                </p>
